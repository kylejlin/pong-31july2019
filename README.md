# pong-31july2019

This repository contains the code a person would write would learn if they followed the [Amethyst Pong Tutorial][pong-tutorial] on 31 July 2019 (i.e., viewing the book as built from [commit 32d13c69d668f072ae4497083c4485cebe8e5a7c](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/commit/32d13c69d668f072ae4497083c4485cebe8e5a7c)).

## Intent

This repository is only intended for my personal use, so I can understand the tutorial-follower's perspective when I am writing a new chapter of the tutorial. However, if you find this useful, feel free to use it.

I also kept track of the errors I found in the tutorial in [TUTORIAL_ERRORS.md][tutorial-errors].
